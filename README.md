By integrating multiple data sources from GitHub, such as **Order**, **People**, and **Return** tables, this dashboard allows users to dynamically analyze and monitor key retail metrics, such as total sales, profit, quantity, order trends, and much more.

Using advanced features of **Power Query Editor** and **dynamic charts**, this dashboard is designed to provide in-depth analyses for business decision-making.

## Features
- **KPI Tracking**: Dynamic tracking of key performance indicators like **Total Sales**, **Profit**, **Quantity**, **Order Count**, and more.
- **Sales & Profit Analysis**: Visual insights into sales trends and profitability across various dimensions.
- **Category-wise Profit**: Breakdown of profits by product category for targeted analysis.
- **Segment-wise Sales Share %**: Visualize how different segments contribute to total sales.
- **Sales by Country**: Geographical distribution of sales across countries.
- **Top 5 & Bottom 5 Subcategories**: Identifying the best and worst-performing subcategories.
- **Yearly Sales Trends**: Visualization of sales over the years to track growth or decline.
- **Dynamic Charts**: Automatically update charts as data is filtered based on the selection in the **KPI table**.

## Data Sources
The dashboard integrates three primary data tables:
1. **Order**: Contains all order details, including sales figures, product information, and customer details.
2. **People**: Information about sales representatives and the regions they operate in.
3. **Return**: Data on the returned orders, including the order ID and market region.

The data from these tables is automatically pulled from the GitHub repository and transformed using **Power Query Editor**.
